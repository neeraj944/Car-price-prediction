# Car-price-prediction
This project focuses on predicting car prices in the US market using machine learning regression techniques.

Objectives:
Load and preprocess the car dataset.

Implement multiple regression models to predict car prices:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor

Evaluate model performance using R², MSE, and MAE.

Identify significant features influencing car price.

Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Optionally, predict the price of a new car based on user-defined features.
